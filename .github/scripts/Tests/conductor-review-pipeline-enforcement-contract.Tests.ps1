.SYNOPSIS
    Contract tests for Code-Conductor review pipeline enforcement before PR completion.

.DESCRIPTION
    Locks issue #421 acceptance criteria: Code-Conductor must have a hard enforcement
    check ensuring prosecution, defense, and judgment all ran before PR creation.
    Partial review must not silently pass as full review.

    Verifies:
      - Code-Conductor stopping rules include a review pipeline completeness hard stop.
      - Code-Conductor Step 4 (PR creation) contains an explicit review pipeline gate.
      - Code-Conductor Review Reconciliation Loop documents review-state persistence to session memory.
      - review-reconciliation.md documents the Review Pipeline Completion Gate with state schema.
      - An abbreviated review path is explicitly documented and surfaced (not silently permitted).
