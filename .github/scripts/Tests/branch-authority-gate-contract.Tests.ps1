.SYNOPSIS
    Contract tests for Code-Conductor Branch Authority Gate wording.

.DESCRIPTION
    Locks the issue #205 branch-authority contract in:
      - agents/Code-Conductor.agent.md

        The file must describe the same semantics for:
            - attached branch context is advisory only
            - live git is canonical before branch mutation
            - a Branch Authority Gate runs immediately before branch create, checkout, rename, and cleanup actions
            - mismatch handling is stop, reconcile, and document the verified branch before any branch-changing action continues
            - same-tip duplicates remain non-destructive

        These tests lock the landed branch-authority wording for issue #205 going forward; update them only when the contract semantics intentionally change.
