.SYNOPSIS
    Contract tests for guidance complexity ceiling wiring.

.DESCRIPTION
    Locks the issue #211 guidance complexity contract across:
      - .github/agents/Process-Review.agent.md (§4.7, §4.8, §4.9)
      - .github/config/guidance-complexity.json
      - .github/scripts/measure-guidance-complexity.ps1
      - Documents/Design/guidance-complexity.md

        The files must satisfy:
            - §4.7 invokes measure-guidance-complexity.ps1 and makes output available to §4.9
            - §4.9 references compression_required and agents_over_ceiling, scoped to agent-prompt proposals
            - §4.8 and §4.9 share consistent trigger scope: both skip only CE Gate Track 2, both run during calibration-only mode
            - .github/config/guidance-complexity.json exists with a valid schema (version + default_ceiling.max_directives)
            - .github/scripts/measure-guidance-complexity.ps1 exists
            - Documents/Design/guidance-complexity.md documents D1, D2, and the compression concept

        These tests lock the landed issue #211 wiring so future edits to Process-Review, the config, or the
        design doc do not silently drift from the complexity-ceiling contract.
