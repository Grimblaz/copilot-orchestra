.SYNOPSIS
    Contract tests for handoff persistence wording and pipeline gate markers.

.DESCRIPTION
    Locks the execution handoff persistence contract across:
      - agents/Issue-Planner.agent.md
      - agents/Code-Conductor.agent.md
      - .github/copilot-instructions.md
    - skills/tracking-format/SKILL.md
      - .github/prompts/start-issue.prompt.md
      - Documents/Design/plan-storage.md
      - Documents/Design/hub-mode-ux.md

        The files must describe the same semantics for:
            - Issue-Planner persists only session-memory artifacts at plan time
            - Code-Conductor D9 owns durable GitHub handoff persistence
            - Stop or pause persists durable handoff comments; Continue stays session-memory-only
            - Solution-Designer issue-body persistence remains unconditional
            - Canonical plan and design markers remain unchanged
            - Latest-comment-wins lookup and bundle plan naming remain unchanged
            - First-contact provenance gate trigger and marker reference present

        These tests actively enforce the D9-owned handoff persistence wording contract (issue #186) and the provenance gate trigger contract (issue #300), guarding against future contract drift.
