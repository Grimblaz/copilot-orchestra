.SYNOPSIS
    Regression coverage for fresh hub-mode planning in the Claude /orchestrate path.

.DESCRIPTION
    Locks the issue #403 follow-up fix: /orchestrate must not require an existing
    plan marker before dispatch, and the shared Code-Conductor body must allow
    hub mode to continue into Issue-Planner when no plan exists yet.
