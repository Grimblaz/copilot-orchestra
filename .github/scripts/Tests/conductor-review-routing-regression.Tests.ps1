.SYNOPSIS
    Regression coverage for GitHub-review routing and response-posting behavior in Code-Conductor.

.DESCRIPTION
    Locks issue #403 follow-up behavior restoration: the shared Code-Conductor review loop
    must preserve GitHub review intake trigger routing and the extracted review reference
    must retain the proxy-review response-posting rule that existed before the refactor.
