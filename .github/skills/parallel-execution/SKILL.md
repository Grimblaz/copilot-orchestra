# Parallel Execution Skill

Execution protocol for implementation steps that may run in parallel or serial mode.

## Mode Declaration

For each implementation step, declare one mode before delegation:

- `Execution Mode: parallel`
- `Execution Mode: serial`

Record the declaration in:

1. Conductor progress log header
2. Step metadata/state (`step.metadata.execution_mode`)
3. User-facing progress update
4. Step commit details if tracked in the plan

## Requirement Contract (Mandatory)

Before delegation, define a shared Requirement Contract for the step:

1. Acceptance criteria slice for the step
2. Explicit invariants and edge cases
3. Non-goals for this step

Both implementation and testing lanes must use this same contract.

## Protocol

1. **Choose mode** using stability/risk criteria.
2. **Create Requirement Contract** before any lane starts.
3. **Run lanes**:
   - `parallel`: launch Code-Smith and Test-Writer against the same contract.
   - `serial`: run one lane first, then the second against the same contract.
4. **Run triage** via Test-Writer after outputs are available.
5. **Classify failures** as `code defect`, `test defect`, or `harness/env defect` with evidence.
6. **Route corrections bidirectionally** until convergence:
   - `code defect` → Code-Smith
   - `test defect` → Test-Writer
   - `harness/env defect` → responsible specialist/tooling path
7. **Enforce convergence gate** before advancing.

## Convergence Gate (Mandatory)

Do not advance phase until Test-Writer explicitly confirms:

- Green tests
- Valid assertions
- No brittle coupling

## Loop Budget

- Maximum 3 correction cycles per step.
- If exceeded, perform root-cause review and escalate via `ask_questions` with a recommended option.

## Anti-Test-Chasing Guardrail

Code-Smith must satisfy the Requirement Contract and architecture constraints, not merely optimize for currently failing assertions.

If a property/test appears over-constrained or invalid, classify as potential `test defect` and route back for test review with evidence.

## Post-Issue Checkpoint (Mandatory)

At issue/PR completion, record a short process checkpoint:

- What slowed us down?
- What failed late that should fail earlier?
- What single guardrail should be added next?

Track this in the completion summary to improve future cycles.
