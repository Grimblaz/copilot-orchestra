# Property-Based Testing Skill

Use PBT as a complement to example-based tests.

## Rollout Policy

1. Start in domain logic with pure invariants first.
2. Keep existing unit/integration tests as readability and regression anchors.
3. Begin with small run counts in PR CI, then increase in scheduled or nightly runs.
4. Require reproducible seeds in all failure reports.
5. Avoid initial rollout in UI/adapters until core invariants are stable.

## Guardrails

- Do not replace readable example-based tests with PBT.
- Keep properties behavior-focused, not implementation-coupled.
- Treat flaky generators/shrinking issues as `test defect` and route for test refinement.
- If infrastructure instability dominates, classify as `harness/env defect` and fix the harness before expanding PBT scope.

## Adoption Guidance

- Start with a small invariant set and expand gradually.
- Add PBT where domain rules are stable and deterministic.
- Scale run volume only after repeated stable results.
