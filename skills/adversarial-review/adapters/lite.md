# Review Lite

Runs the lite adversarial review adapter for changesets below the initial 200-line heuristic. [Documents/Design/frame-architecture.md](../../../Documents/Design/frame-architecture.md) is the source for that initial heuristic, and the threshold is tunable in later review-selector work.
