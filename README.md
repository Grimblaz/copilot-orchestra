# Copilot Workflow Template

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.4.0-blue.svg)](../../releases)
[![Ready for Production](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-production%20ready-green.svg)](../../releases)

A multi-agent workflow system for GitHub Copilot that orchestrates AI-assisted software development across specialized agents.

## Quick Start — Two Steps

### Step 1: Clone or fork this template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO.git
cd YOUR-REPO
```

Or click **"Use this template"** &rarr; **"Create a new repository"** on GitHub.

### Step 2: Run the setup wizard

Type `/setup` in GitHub Copilot Chat and answer the questions. Copilot will fill in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/architecture-rules.md` for your project automatically.

> **Prefer to do it manually?** Open `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/architecture-rules.md` — both are pre-created with `<!-- TODO: ... -->` markers guiding every field. See `examples/` for complete filled-in references.

That's it. You're ready to use agents.

## Using the Agents

### I want to

| Goal | Start here |
|------|-----------|
| Pick up a GitHub issue and design a solution | `@Issue-Designer` |
| Create an implementation plan for an issue | `@Issue-Planner` |
| Implement a planned feature end-to-end | `@Code-Conductor` |
| Review code and identify risks | `@Code-Critic` |
| Respond to a code review | `@Code-Review-Response` |
| Clean up completed work / archive tracking files | `@Janitor` |

### Core Workflow

```text
Issue → @Issue-Designer → @Issue-Planner → @Code-Conductor → PR
```

1. **@Issue-Designer** — picks up the issue, explores the design space, updates the issue body with a design
2. **@Issue-Planner** — creates a step-by-step implementation plan as an issue comment
3. **@Code-Conductor** — reads the plan, delegates to internal specialist agents, creates a merge-ready PR

### Example: Start a feature from scratch

```markdown
@Issue-Designer Please design issue #42.
```

Then, once the design is in the issue:

```markdown
@Code-Conductor Issue #42 is designed and planned. Please implement it.
```

## Agent Reference

### Agents you interact with directly (6)

| Agent | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Issue-Designer** | Design exploration and issue management |
| **Issue-Planner** | Multi-step implementation plan creation |
| **Code-Conductor** | End-to-end orchestration of implementation |
| **Code-Critic** | Adversarial code review and risk discovery |
| **Code-Review-Response** | Adjudicates review feedback and delegates fixes |
| **Janitor** | Cleanup, archiving, and tech debt tasks |

### Internal agents (called automatically by Code-Conductor)

These agents are hidden from the picker (`user-invokable: false`) and are used automatically during `@Code-Conductor` workflows:

Code-Smith, Test-Writer, Refactor-Specialist, Doc-Keeper, Research-Agent, Process-Review, Specification, UI-Iterator

> See `.github/agents/` for full definitions of all 14 agents.

## Skills Framework

Skills are domain-specific knowledge packages in `.github/skills/` that agents load on demand:

| Skill | When it's used |
|-------|---------------|
| **test-driven-development** | Writing tests, red-green-refactor |
| **systematic-debugging** | Investigating complex bugs |
| **software-architecture** | Evaluating design decisions |
| **brainstorming** | Exploring requirements or trade-offs |
| **frontend-design** | Building UI components |
| **ui-testing** | React component test strategies |
| **webapp-testing** | Playwright end-to-end tests |
| **verification-before-completion** | Pre-PR readiness checks |
| **skill-creator** | Adding new skills to the framework |

> **VS Code 1.108+**: Skills are auto-discovered from `.github/skills/` when `chat.useAgentSkills` is enabled.

## Configuration Files

| File | Purpose | Status on clone |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Project context, tech stack, conventions | Pre-created with TODO markers |
| `.github/architecture-rules.md` | Layer rules, dependency rules, naming | Pre-created with TODO markers |
| `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | Agent definitions | Ready to use, customize as needed |
| `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Domain knowledge | Ready to use, add your own |

---

## Examples

Three complete filled-in examples showing what your config files should look like:

| Stack | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Spring Boot (Java) | `examples/spring-boot-microservice/` |
| Express (TypeScript) | `examples/nodejs-typescript/` |
| FastAPI (Python) | `examples/python/` |

---

## Global Setup (Optional): Use Agents Across All Repositories

You can make all agents available globally in VS Code — not just in repos that have cloned this template — by adding this setting to your VS Code user settings (`Ctrl+,` &rarr; open `settings.json`):

```json
{
  "chat.agentFilesLocations": [
    "/path/to/your/workflow-template/.github/agents"
  ]
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/workflow-template` with the absolute path to where you cloned this repo. VS Code will load agent definitions from that folder for all workspaces.

> **Tip**: Use this when you want the workflow agents available in all your projects, even ones that haven't cloned this template. You can also add both a global path and a per-project `.github/agents/` folder — VS Code merges them.
