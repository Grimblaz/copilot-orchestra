# Design: Replace Janitor Agent with SessionStart Hook

**Issue**: #36
**Date**: 2026-03-02
**Status**: Finalized
**Branch**: feature/issue-36-janitor-to-hook

## Summary

Retires the Janitor agent entirely by converting its mechanical cleanup work into a VS Code Copilot `SessionStart` hook and absorbing remaining judgment-based responsibilities into existing pipeline stages.

---

## Problem

The Janitor agent was invoked manually (or by Code-Conductor as a subagent in Step 0) to handle post-merge cleanup: archiving tracking files, deleting branches, closing issues, knowledge capture, and tech debt remediation. Most of this work is mechanical and deterministic — a poor fit for an LLM agent. The remaining judgment work is either already handled by the existing pipeline or rare enough to not warrant a dedicated agent.

## Design Decisions

| # | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Mechanism | VS Code `SessionStart` hook | Fires at the natural "ready for next work" moment — after the user has merged the PR and starts a new session. Zero overhead for sessions with nothing to clean. |
| D2 | Confirmation model | Agent-mediated via `ask_questions` | `PreToolUse` is the only hook with `permissionDecision: "ask"` but doesn't fit the trigger pattern. Agent-mediated confirmation is functionally equivalent. |
| D3 | Janitor retirement | Remove entirely; absorb all capabilities | See capability map below. |
| D4 | Implementation language | PowerShell (`.ps1`) | Supports both parameterized invocation and hook-triggered flow. Cross-platform via `pwsh`. |
| D5 | Issue closure | `Closes #N` in PR body | GitHub's auto-close mechanism is sufficient — no summary comment needed. |
| D6 | Knowledge capture | Dropped | Pipeline already produces durable artifacts (design in issue body, `Documents/Design/` file, PR description). Rare novel insights are left as manual developer actions. |

---

## Capability Map

| Former Janitor Capability | New Home |
|---|---|
| Archive tracking files | `SessionStart` hook → cleanup script |
| Delete branches (local + remote) | Cleanup script |
| Switch to main + git pull | Cleanup script |
| Close GitHub issue | `Closes #N` in PR body (automated by Code-Conductor) |
| Summary comment on issue | Dropped (PR description is the durable record) |
| Tech debt issue closure | Code-Conductor adds `Closes #tech-debt-N` to PR body |
| Knowledge capture (ADRs) | Dropped (pipeline artifacts suffice) |
| Remove obsolete files | Already handled by Code-Smith / Refactor-Specialist |

---

## Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/hooks/session-cleanup.json` | `SessionStart` hook configuration |
| `.github/scripts/session-cleanup-detector.ps1` | Dual-path detection: (1) current branch stale check, (2) stale `.copilot-tracking/` file check — no-op if nothing to clean |
| `.github/scripts/post-merge-cleanup.ps1` | Archives tracking files, deletes branches, syncs default branch |

---

## Hook Flow (User Experience)

1. Code-Conductor creates PR with `Closes #N` → session ends
2. User reviews and merges PR on GitHub (issue auto-closes)
3. User starts a new agent session (any agent)
4. `SessionStart` hook fires silently — checks (a) whether the current branch's remote was deleted and (b) stale `.copilot-tracking/` files from the merged branch; either signal triggers cleanup context
5. Injects `additionalContext`: describes what needs cleanup
6. Agent asks user via `ask_questions`: context message reflects which signal(s) fired — stale remote branch (e.g. "Still on merged branch `feature/issue-N`"), stale tracking files (e.g. "Found stale tracking files from issue #N"), or both when both are detected simultaneously; message ends with "Clean up?"
7. If confirmed → runs `post-merge-cleanup.ps1`
8. Script archives files, deletes local/remote branch, syncs default branch

---

## Rejected Alternatives

| Alternative | Reason Rejected |
|-------------|----------------|
| `Stop` hook | PR is not merged yet when Code-Conductor finishes |
| `PostToolUse` hook | `matchers` field is ignored; fires for ALL tools |
| Git `post-merge` hook | Not integrated with agent workflow context |

---

## Post-Ship Enhancement (Issue #40)

**Problem found**: The original hook silently no-oped when `.copilot-tracking/` was empty (no tracking files created during the issue lifecycle), even when the user was still on the merged feature branch.

**Fix shipped**: `session-cleanup-detector.ps1` now runs two independent detection paths:

1. **Branch check** (new, runs first): Detects when the current branch has upstream tracking configured but no remote — indicating the branch was merged and the remote deleted. Guards against false positives on local-only branches (no upstream = never pushed = skip).
2. **Tracking file check** (original, unchanged): Detects stale `.copilot-tracking/` files for issues whose remote branch is gone.

When both signals fire, the branch signal leads the cleanup prompt. When only the branch signal fires (no tracking files), the cleanup command still correctly invokes `post-merge-cleanup.ps1` with the issue number (extracted best-effort from the branch name) or falls back to plain git commands for non-convention branch names.

## Notes

- VS Code 1.109.3+ required for the `SessionStart` hook (Preview feature)
- Hook fires every session until cleanup is run — intentional persistent reminder
- Linux/macOS without `pwsh`: hook uses bash fallback (exits cleanly without a warning)
- CE Gate: Not applicable — no customer surface
