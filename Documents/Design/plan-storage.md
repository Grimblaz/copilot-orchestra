# Design: Plan Storage

**Domain**: Plan persistence and retrieval across agents
**Status**: Current
**Implemented in**: Issue #62

---

## Overview

Plans are stored in VS Code session memory at `/memories/session/plan-issue-{ID}.md` using the `memory` tool's `create` command. This replaces the previous approach of storing plans as local files in `.copilot-tracking/plans/`.

---

## Storage Architecture

| Layer | Location | Created by | Required |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| Primary | `/memories/session/plan-issue-{ID}.md` | Issue-Planner (`memory` tool `create`) | Yes |
| Secondary | GitHub issue comment with `<!-- plan-issue-{ID} -->` as first line | Issue-Planner (opt-in) | No |

### Lookup Chain (Code-Conductor)

1. Session memory — `view /memories/session/plan-issue-{ID}.md`
2. GitHub issue comment — search for `<!-- plan-issue-{ID} -->` marker
3. Escalate via `vscode/askQuestions` if neither source found

---

## Plan Format

```markdown
---
status: pending
priority: p2          # p1=high, p2=medium, p3=low; no label → p2
issue_id: "NNN"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
ce_gate: false        # true if CE Gate is required

## Design Decisions

### D1 — Session memory as primary storage

Session memory is immediately available, requires no file system operations, and avoids gitignored-file management overhead. Limitation: cleared when the VS Code conversation ends.

### D2 — GitHub issue comment as optional persistence

Providing an opt-in GitHub issue comment gives cross-session and cloud-agent handoff support without polluting issue threads for simple same-session work. The `<!-- plan-issue-{ID} -->` HTML comment on the first line is the canonical detection marker.

Default answer to the prompt is **No** (session memory only).

### D3 — Removal of `.copilot-tracking/plans/`

Only the `plans/` subdirectory was removed. The `research/` subdirectory and any archived files remain under `.copilot-tracking/`. Session-cleanup detector test fixtures were updated to reference `research/` paths.

## Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| Issue-Planner (Section 6) | Write plan to session memory; prompt for optional issue-comment persistence |
| Code-Conductor (Step 1) | Read plan using the lookup chain above |
| Specialist agents | Reference "plan" (not "plan file") in instructions |

## Design Cache

The design cache stores the full design content from the GitHub issue body in a readily accessible location that survives conversation compaction.

### Design Cache Storage Architecture

| Layer | Location | Created by | Required |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| Primary | `/memories/session/design-issue-{ID}.md` | Issue-Planner (Section 6) after plan approval | No |
| Secondary | GitHub issue comment with `<!-- design-issue-{ID} -->` as first line | Issue-Planner (opt-in, same single "Yes" prompt as plan comment) | No |

### Design Cache Lookup Chain (Code-Conductor)

1. Session memory — `view /memories/session/design-issue-{ID}.md`
2. GitHub issue comment — search for `<!-- design-issue-{ID} -->` marker
3. Fall back: read issue body directly and create the cache file (fallback creator role)

### File Format

```markdown
<!-- design-issue-{ID} -->
{Full issue body content verbatim}

---
**Source**: Snapshot of issue #{ID} body at plan creation. Design changes require a new plan.
```

The cache stores the complete issue body content — no curation or summarization. Curation risks filtering out exactly the details that matter during implementation.

### Design Cache Decisions

#### DC1 — Full verbatim content, not a curated summary

Summarizing introduces the same context-loss risk the cache is intended to solve — the summarizer might filter out critical details. A typical Solution-Designer output (decisions, AC, constraints, rationale) is small enough that full verbatim content is not a context-window concern in practice.

#### DC2 — Session memory as primary, issue body as source of truth

The session memory file is a cache, not the source of truth. The GitHub issue body remains authoritative. On session reset, Code-Conductor recreates the cache from the issue body (fallback creator role).

#### DC3 — No staleness detection

Design should be settled before implementation begins. Mid-implementation design changes are exceptional — if they occur, the user should restart the affected plan steps. Adding issue-body re-reads at every phase boundary would reintroduce the API-call dependency the cache is meant to eliminate.

### Design Cache Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| Issue-Planner (Section 6) | Create design cache to session memory after plan approval; optionally persist as GitHub issue comment (same "Yes" prompt as plan) |
| Code-Conductor (Step 1) | Read design cache using lookup chain above; recreate from issue body if absent (session reset recovery) |
| Code-Conductor (Step 3) | Re-read design cache at major phase boundaries for alignment checks |
| Code-Conductor (CE Gate) | Read design intent from cache (fallback: issue body) |
| Specialist agents with Plan Tracking | Read design cache at startup for full design requirements context |

## VS Code 1.110 Compaction Resilience

VS Code 1.110 introduced **automatic context compaction** — when the context window fills, VS Code compacts conversation history automatically without user intervention. This is distinct from the manual `/compact` command. The interaction with the plan and design cache strategy is documented here.

### How 1.110 Auto-Compaction Interacts with the Storage Strategy

The session memory strategy (primary plan store at `/memories/session/plan-issue-{ID}.md`, design cache at `/memories/session/design-issue-{ID}.md`) was designed specifically to survive compaction. VS Code 1.110 confirms this design remains correct:

| Event | Plan/design cache outcome |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Manual `/compact` (user-initiated) | Session memory files survive — accessible immediately after compaction |
| Auto-compaction (VS Code 1.110+ trigger) | Session memory files survive — same durable store, same outcome |
| Session end (conversation closed) | Session memory cleared — plan/design cache lost |
| Cross-session or cloud agent handoff | Requires GitHub issue comment persistence (opt-in "Yes" at plan creation) |

### Progress Checkpointing (1.110 Addition)

Code-Conductor now maintains progress annotations in the session memory plan file: each completed step's title line is annotated with `— ✅ DONE`. This ensures:

1. **Deterministic post-compaction resume**: Code-Conductor can identify the first incomplete step by scanning for title lines not ending in `— ✅ DONE`, without re-deriving progress from git state.
2. **Cross-session recovery**: If the plan was persisted as a GitHub issue comment, Code-Conductor recreates the session memory plan file from the comment on session reset, then uses branch-state inference to determine the resume point (the persisted comment does not contain `— ✅ DONE` annotations; those exist only in the live session memory file).

**Implementation**: Code-Conductor's Step 3 execution loop uses `vscode/memory str_replace` to append exactly `— ✅ DONE` to the completed step's title line. This is atomic (no risk of double annotation), preserves all other step content, and produces a scannable text marker.

### Custom `/compact` Instructions

VS Code 1.110 allows agents to supply custom instructions to the compaction summarizer via `/compact focus on: ...`. This feature complements session memory by ensuring the auto-generated summary retains orchestration-critical context (issue ID, step progress, design intent, open decisions) alongside the durable plan file.

- **Code-Conductor** template: preserves issue number, step progress, branch name, design intent summary, and open blockers (see `.github/agents/Code-Conductor.agent.md`)
- **Issue-Planner** template: preserves design decisions, rejected alternatives with rationale, acceptance criteria, open questions, CE Gate assessment (see `.github/agents/Issue-Planner.agent.md`)

These templates use bracket-token substitution so each invocation carries session-specific values, not static categories.

### Design Validation

The existing storage strategy (session memory primary, GitHub issue comment secondary, issue body as source of truth) remains sound under 1.110's auto-compaction model. The 1.110 addition improves the strategy in three ways:

1. Proactive compaction at phase boundaries (reduces probability of mid-step auto-compaction)
2. Progress annotation for deterministic step tracking after compaction
3. Custom compaction instructions to preserve orchestration context across compaction events

No changes to the storage architecture, lookup chain, or fallback logic were required.
