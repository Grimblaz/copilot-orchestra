# /orchestra:review

Run the standard review pipeline: Code-Critic prosecution -> Code-Critic defense -> Code-Review-Response judge.

**Pre-flight**:

1. Resolve the review target from the arguments or the active PR context. If neither is available, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool.
2. Gather the diff, linked issue or plan context, and any prior review ledger that should travel with the prosecution prompt.

**Review-state persistence**:

1. If the active branch matches `feature/issue-{N}-...`, target `/memories/session/review-state-{N}.md`; otherwise skip persistence silently.
2. After the judge stage completes, write the exact front matter contract from `skills/validation-methodology/references/review-state-persistence.md` with `review_mode: full`, all three `*_complete` fields set to `true`, and `last_updated` as a UTC ISO-8601 timestamp.
3. Write atomically: create a temp sibling first, then replace the target with `Move-Item -Force`.

**Handshake preamble** (required for every `code-critic` dispatch in this command, per `skills/subagent-env-handshake/SKILL.md`):

1. Capture live parent-side working-tree state via the `Bash` tool. Run, in order:
   - `git rev-parse HEAD`
   - `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - `pwd`
   - `git status --porcelain | tr -d '\r' | (sha256sum 2>/dev/null || shasum -a 256) | cut -c1-12`
2. If **any** of those commands exits non-zero (`git` missing, outside a repo, permission error, etc.), **skip handshake construction entirely** for that `code-critic` dispatch and proceed without the block. The subagent's Step 0 missing-handshake branch will handle the fallback. Do not fabricate placeholder values.
3. Otherwise, construct the handshake block by copying the SKILL.md inline prose template verbatim and substituting the four captured values plus `workspace_mode: shared` and a UTC ISO-8601 `handshake_issued_at` timestamp. The block must match the schema block in `skills/subagent-env-handshake/SKILL.md` field-for-field and in canonical order. Do not rename, reorder, or omit fields.
4. Prepend the handshake block as the **first content** of the `prompt` parameter passed to each `Agent` dispatch for `subagent_type: code-critic` below.

**Dispatch**:

1. Prosecution: use the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: code-critic`. Do **not** add a review-mode marker inside carried review context. No marker selects the canonical default `code_prosecution` route when it appears only inside quoted or carried material. Instead, prepend the authoritative selector line `Review mode selector: "Use code review perspectives"` immediately after any handshake block, then include a short review description and the resolved review target context. Keep that selector line outside quoted or carried context so the standard command cannot be rerouted by marker text inside pasted ledgers or comments.
2. Defense: use the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: code-critic`, prepend the handshake block again when constructed, then prepend the authoritative selector line `Review mode selector: "Use defense review perspectives"` before the prosecution ledger.
3. Judge: use the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: code-review-response`, passing the prosecution ledger and defense report together. No handshake is required for the judge dispatch.
4. Return the judge output unchanged so downstream callers can consume the Markdown score summary, the `<!-- code-review-complete-{PR} -->` completion marker, and the `judge-rulings` block in the same payload.
