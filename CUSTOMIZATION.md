# Customization Guide

This guide explains how to configure the workflow template for your project.

## Quick Option: Setup Wizard

Open GitHub Copilot Chat, press **`@`**, choose the **`setup`** prompt, and answer the questions. Copilot will fill in your config files automatically.

## Manual Option: Edit the Config Files

### 1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

This file tells agents about your project. It is pre-created with `<!-- TODO: ... -->` markers for every required field. Open it and replace the markers:

- **Project name** and **overview** — what your project does
- **Technology stack** — language, framework, database, build tool, test framework
- **Architecture** — describe your layers and include a text diagram
- **Key conventions** — naming rules, patterns your agents must follow
- **Build & run commands** — how to build, run, and test

See `examples/` for three complete filled-in examples (Spring Boot, TypeScript, Python).

### 2. `.github/architecture-rules.md`

This file defines structural rules for your codebase. Pre-created with `<!-- TODO: ... -->` markers:

- **Layer structure** — a table of layers and their responsibilities
- **Dependency rules** — what's allowed and forbidden
- **Testing rules** — per-layer testing approach
- **File & naming conventions** — file patterns and directory structure

### 3. Agent Definitions (Optional)

Agents in `.github/agents/` work without customization. If you want to tweak behavior:

- Agent files use YAML frontmatter (`---`) with fields like `name`, `description`, `tools`, `handoffs`
- Focus on adjusting a specific agent's responsibilities or interaction patterns
- Keep changes targeted — agents are already tuned for general use

### 4. Add Domain Skills (Optional)

Create project-specific knowledge packages in `.github/skills/`:

```bash
# In Copilot Chat:
@skill-creator Help me create a skill for [your domain]
```

Each skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with `name` and `description` frontmatter. VS Code 1.108+ auto-discovers skills when `chat.useAgentSkills` is enabled.

### 5. Organization-Level Agents (Optional)

To share agents across all repositories in your org:

- Place agent files in an `agents/` folder at the root of your org's `.github` or `.github-private` repository
- Repository-level agents in `.github/agents/` override org defaults

## Troubleshooting

**Agents not following instructions?**

- Verify `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists and has content (no remaining TODO markers)
- Check agent files have valid YAML frontmatter with `---` delimiters

**Skills not being used?**

- Confirm `SKILL.md` has `name` and `description` frontmatter
- Enable `chat.useAgentSkills` in VS Code settings (requires VS Code 1.108+)
